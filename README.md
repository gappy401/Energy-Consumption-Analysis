# Energy-Consumption-Analysis

The project's primary objectives encompass uncovering the key factors
influencing energy consumption, investigating its relationship with
temperature variations in July, pinpointing significant determinants,
offering practical recommendations for energy conservation, and
demonstrating the effectiveness of energy reduction strategies using
predictive modeling.
Our initial steps involve exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data
cleaning, followed by the development of predictive models. Within the
dataset under analysis lies a wealth of information about individual
residences, encompassing unique building IDs and specific attributes
associated with each property. Furthermore, the dataset provides
intricate hour-by-hour details of energy consumption patterns in these
residences.
Moreover, the dataset meticulously integrates hour-by-hour weather
data, systematically organized according to geographic regions. This
weather information serves as a critical external factor significantly
shaping energy usage patterns across diverse regions.
The object of this project is to answer the following questions :
1. Identify Factors Affecting Energy Consumption.
2. Analyse Energy Consumption Variation with Temperature Increase
in July.
3. Identify Significant Factors Impacting Energy Consumption.
4. Recommend for Decreasing Energy Consumption.
5. Demonstrate Energy Consumption Reduction via a Model.
