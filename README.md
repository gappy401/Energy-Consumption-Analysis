# Energy-Consumption-Analysis

The project's primary objectives encompass uncovering the key factors
influencing energy consumption, investigating its relationship with
temperature variations in July, pinpointing significant determinants,
offering practical recommendations for energy conservation, and
demonstrating the effectiveness of energy reduction strategies using
predictive modeling.
Our initial steps involve exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data
cleaning, followed by the development of predictive models. Within the
dataset under analysis lies a wealth of information about individual
residences, encompassing unique building IDs and specific attributes
associated with each property. Furthermore, the dataset provides
hour-by-hour details of energy consumption patterns in these
residences.

The object of this project is to answer the following questions :
1. Identify Factors Affecting Energy Consumption.
2. Analyse Energy Consumption Variation with Temperature Increase
in July.
3. Identify Significant Factors Impacting Energy Consumption.
4. Recommend for Decreasing Energy Consumption.
5. Demonstrate Energy Consumption Reduction via a Model.

# How to Navigate this Repository?

Our Final Analysis is in the Final-Doucment, it encloses details of the data along with the projected energy consumption and how to reduce it. The two ".RMD" files consist of the code and the similar PDF files showcase the output of the same. Please note that there are no data sources as they are not available for public use.
